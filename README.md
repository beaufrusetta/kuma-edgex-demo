# EdgeX Demo using Kuma Service Mesh
I have been looking for a way to manage securing the service to service communications within EdgeX without requiring any code changes on the micro-services. I also wanted have this all up and running inside of Docker containers given that it is relatively easy to deploy containers. This demo can be done utilizing services running within the OS, however, at this time, this demo is 100% based on deploying within Docker containers.

To read up on Kuma, you can visit their [web site](https://kuma.io/). Kuma is built by the lovely peeps that build [Kong](https://konghq.com/kong/).
